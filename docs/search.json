But I think all of you should read it to be successful in this class.\nGroup b: Zuur, Ieno, and Elphick (2010) if you have already read Tredennick et al. (2021), this is the one you should read.\n\n\n2.1.2 Deliverable:\nYou will give a short lecture ~15 to 20 minutes on the most important aspects of your paper to the other group. YOU ARE THE EXPERTS, so make sure you can answer questions from your “students”. You can use slides, but you don’t have to. You will self-govern your group. Each member can present, just two, or have a single person present."

For this class, your goal is to understand three ideas: (1) science as an iteration between theory and data, (2) models as deliberately false but useful, and (3) the need to check and revise models when they clash with data.\n\n3.1 Session A:\n\n3.1.1 Part 1: Lecture by Team B (~ 25 minutes of the class)\nThe team that did not give their lecture today, will be giving a lecture on choosing models.\n\n\n3.1.2 Part 2: Paper discussion (~25 minutes of the class)\nI will open with a short lecture on Ellison (2004) (15 minutes), then we will have a discussion (15 minutes).\nThe discussion will be guided by some questions I will write.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions To think about while reading\n\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean for a model to be “useful” rather than “true”?\nWhat kinds of uncertainty are explicitly modeled, and which are often ignored?\nHow do Bayesian and frequentist approaches differ in how they treat uncertainty?\nHow do these philosophical perspectives influence how we interpret results in applied research?\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Part 2: Dataset/coding\nWe will start coding here. The objective will be to run a Bayesian example on Thursday\n\n\n3.1.4 Exit ticket\nWhat was the most challenging thing about today?\n\n\n\n3.2 Session B\nMethods workshop — hands-on coding Session B has been cancelled"

YOU ARE THE EXPERTS, so make sure you can answer questions from your “students”. You can use slides, but you don’t have to. You will self-govern your group. Each member can present, just two, or have a single person present.\nYou will have ~10 minutes at the beginning of class to ask questions and make a plan\n\n\n\n2.2 Part 2: Github and R\nMake sure you have downloaded the following:\n\nProgram R\nRStudio\nKnow basics of R and RStudio: https://moctezumaii.github.io/SNR610/installation_instructions.html\nRStudio\nCreate a Github account\nApply for GitHub Education\nJoin the course repository (you will be invited, accept the invite)\nConfirm Codespaces access (we will provide guidance; Codespaces may be enabled by GitHub Education or by the organization)\n\n\n\n2.3 Part 3: Look for papers\nPlease send me any and all papers that you find interesting, would be interested in my taking into account for the course!\nYou should start looking for the paper you want to lead the discussion on!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther tasks to come\n\n\n\nThese are tasks that will come when we start the “collaborative section of the course”\n\nJoin the course repository (you will be invited, accept the invite 😄\nConfirm Codespaces access (I will provide guidance)"
