But I think all of you should read it to be successful in this class.\nGroup b: Zuur, Ieno, and Elphick (2010) if you have already read Tredennick et al. (2021), this is the one you should read.\n\n\n2.1.2 Deliverable:\nYou will give a short lecture ~15 to 20 minutes on the most important aspects of your paper to the other group. YOU ARE THE EXPERTS, so make sure you can answer questions from your “students”. You can use slides, but you don’t have to. You will self-govern your group. Each member can present, just two, or have a single person present."

How do you keep track of which analyses were exploratory vs. confirmatory?\nWeek 2 introduced the idea that all models are wrong but some are useful. If you try multiple models, how do you record which ones you tried, why you chose one over another, and what changed?\nWeek 3 showed us the Method-Question-Data Triangle and the dangers of mismatch vs. overcomplication. When you iterate through model choices - trying a lm(), realizing you need a glmer(), adding random effects - how do you track that evolution?\n\nVersion control can help us with this And at WORST… it is a great tool to have!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Week 3 Simulations\n\n\n\nMany of you found the simulation exercises in Week 3 challenging - simulating data that matches a scenario description, then fitting both the “proposed” (wrong) and “correct” models. That’s completely normal. Simulating data is a skill that takes practice.\nSession B this week is designed to give you a second pass at those simulations. The first hands-on activity will walk through the Week 3 simulation & analysis exercises together, step by step. Then we’ll layer Git on top, so you’re learning version control with familiar code rather than starting from scratch."

    "text": "2.4 Part 2: Simulation Exercises — Start Simple, No Transformations (≈45 min)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rule: Start Simple\n\n\n\nWe are deliberately keeping this simple today. I am providing the simulation… Look at it, and figure out what I did different than you\nThis is what you will be doing here: 1. Simulate data where you know the truth (you have the parameters and I provided the code this time) 2. Comment on the simulation code explain what each step is doing and why… or at least try to 3. Fit the proposed (wrong) model/method from Week 3. You write the code and explain why it might be problematic 4. Fit the correct model. You propose it, write the code, commit, and push 5. Write it all up in your Quarto document with narrative explaining what you did and why 6. Commit after each step with a meaningful commit message\nThis mirrors the real research process: you try an analysis, realize there’s a problem, and re-analyze correctly. Git tracks every step of that journey.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.1 Activity 1: Salamander Survival (Partner A) — Station 1 from Week 3\nScenario: A researcher wants to know if canopy cover affects salamander survival in forest fragments. They marked 20 salamanders in each of 12 forest fragments and recorded whether each salamander survived (alive/dead) after one year. Canopy cover was measured as a percentage for each fragment.\nThe truth (what we’re simulating):\n\n12 forest fragments\n20 salamanders per fragment (240 total salamanders)\nCanopy cover ranges from 40% to 90%\nTrue effect of canopy cover on survival probability: for every 10% increase in canopy cover, the log-odds of survival increases by 0.09\nWe’ll use a logistic relationship (since survival is binary), but don’t worry about the math - just run the code and comment what each line does\n\n\n2.4.1.1 Step 1: Simulate the data and visualize (20 min)\nCopy the code below into your Quarto document. Your job: add a comment above or next to every line explaining what it does.

(How many fragments? How many salamanders per fragment?) - What is the response variable? What type of variable is it? - Why does this structure matter for the analysis?\n📝 Commit message: \"Simulate salamander survival data - 12 fragments, 20 sal per fragment\"\n\n\n2.4.1.2 Step 2: Fit the proposed (wrong) model from Week 3 (10 min)\nIn Week 3 Station 1, the proposed method was:\n\nLogistic regression: glm(survival ~ canopy_cover, family = binomial) Use the salamander_data data frame, which has one row per salamander, with a binary survived column and a canopy_cover column.\n\nThis treats each salamander as an independent observation. But is that correct?\nYour job:\n\nFit this model using the code below (or write your own):\n\n\nIn your Quarto document, answer these questions:\n\nWhat does this model assume about the salamanders?\nAre salamanders within the same fragment truly independent? Why or why not?\nWhat is the unit of replication in this experiment — the salamander or the fragment?\nWhat problem might arise if we ignore the fragment structure?\nKey question: If salamanders in the same fragment are more similar to each other than to salamanders in other fragments (e.g., because of fragment-specific conditions), what happens to our standard errors and p-values?\n\n\n📝 Commit message: \"Fit proposed model (ignores fragment structure) - identify problem\"\nPush to GitHub.\n\n\n2.4.1.3 Step 3: Fit the correct model (15 min)\nThe correct approach needs to account for the fact that salamanders are grouped within fragments. Salamanders in the same fragment are not independent — they share the same canopy cover, the same local predators, the same microclimate.\nYour job:\n\nPropose a better model. Hints:\n\nYou need to tell the model that salamanders are nested within fragments\nLook at the lme4 package (already loaded at the top)\nThe function you want is glmer() (generalized linear mixed-effects model)\nThe syntax is similar to glm(), but you add a random effect for fragment: (1 | fragment_id)\nExample structure: glmer(response ~ predictor + (1 | grouping_variable), family = binomial, data = ...)\n\nWrite the code to fit the correct model\nIn your Quarto document, answer:\n\nHow did the estimate of the canopy cover effect change?\nHow did the standard error change? (Bigger? Smaller?)\nDid the p-value change?\nWhy does accounting for fragment structure matter?\nWhich model do you trust more, and why?\n\nReplace the proposed model in your document — meaning, re-organize your .qmd so that the correct model comes first, and the wrong model is shown as “what not to do” or moved to an appendix section. This simulates the real research process: you realize you made a mistake, so you re-do the analysis correctly.\n\n📝 Commit message: \"Fit correct model with random effect for fragment - replace wrong approach\"\nPush to GitHub.\n\n\n2.4.1.4 Step 4: Write your conclusions\nAdd a final section called “What I Learned” summarizing: - Why the proposed model was problematic (be specific about pseudoreplication) - Why the correct model is better - One sentence connecting this to the Method-Question-Data Triangle from Week 3 (hint: the question is about canopy cover, but the data have a nested structure — the method must match both)\n📝 Commit message: \"Add conclusions and connect to Week 3 concepts\"\nPush to GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Activity 2: Wheat Yield Trials (Partner B) — Station 2 from Week 3\nScenario: An agronomist wants to know which of 5 wheat varieties produces the highest yield. They use a randomized complete block design: 4 blocks (fields), with one plot per variety per block (20 plots total). Yield (kg/ha) is recorded once per plot.\nThe truth (what we’re simulating):\n\n5 wheat varieties\n4 blocks (to account for field variability)\nTrue variety effects: Variety A is the baseline, B is +200 kg/ha better, C is +350 kg/ha better, D is +100 kg/ha better, E is -50 kg/ha worse\nTrue block effects: Block 1 is baseline, Block 2 is +150 kg/ha, Block 3 is -100 kg/ha, Block 4 is +200 kg/ha (because soil quality varies)\nNoise SD = 120 kg/ha\n\n\n2.4.2.1 Step 1: Simulate the data and visualize (20 min)\nCopy the code below into your Quarto document.

(What is a “block”? Why use blocks?) - What is the response variable? - Why does the block structure matter?\n📝 Commit message: \"Simulate wheat yield data - 5 varieties x 4 blocks\"\n\n\n2.4.2.2 Step 2: Fit the proposed (wrong) model from Week 3 (10 min)\nIn Week 3 Station 2, the proposed method was:\n\nOne-way ANOVA: aov(yield ~ variety)\n\nThis completely ignores the blocks. But blocks were part of the experimental design!\nYour job:\n\nFit this model: write the code to fit the one-way ANOVA that ignores blocks\n\n\nIn your Quarto narrative, answer these questions:\n\nWhat does this model assume about the blocks?\nIf Block 2 has naturally higher-quality soil (true block effect = +150 kg/ha), and we ignore blocks, what happens to the variety estimates?\nWhat problem arises when we ignore a source of variation that we know exists?\nKey question: The blocks were part of the experimental design. If we don’t account for them in the analysis, are we throwing away information? What does that do to our standard errors and our ability to detect real variety differences?\n\n\n📝 Commit message: \"Fit proposed model (ignores blocks) - identify problem\"\nPush to GitHub.\n\n\n2.4.2.3 Step 3: Fit the correct model (15 min)\nThe correct approach is to include both variety AND block in the model. This is a two-way ANOVA (or a linear model with two categorical predictors).\nYour job:\n\nPropose a better model. Hints:\nWrite the code to fit the correct model\nIn your Quarto document, answer:\n\nHow did the F-statistic and p-value for variety change?\nHow did the residual error (residual standard error) change? (Hint: look at summary(proposed_model) vs summary(correct_model))\nCompare the means for each variety from both models — did they change? If so, why?\n\nReplace the proposed model in your document — re-organize your .qmd so the correct analysis comes first, and the wrong model is shown as “what not to do.”\n\n📝 Commit message: \"Fit correct model with block effect - replace wrong approach\"\nPush to GitHub.\n\n\n2.4.2.4 Step 4: Write your conclusions\nAdd a final section called “What I Learned” summarizing: - Why the proposed model was problematic (be specific about ignoring the blocking structure) - Why the correct model is better - One sentence connecting this to the Method-Question-Data Triangle from Week 3 (hint: the question is about varieties, but the data were collected using a blocked design — the method must account for that)\n📝 Commit message: \"Add conclusions and connect to Week 3 concepts\"\nPush to GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat You Just Did\n\n\n\nYou both just completed the full research cycle that Git is designed to track:\n\nSimulate/collect data → commit\nAnalyze using a proposed method → commit\nRealize the method is wrong → write about the problem, commit\nRe-analyze correctly → replace the wrong analysis, commit\nWrite conclusions → commit\n\nYour Git history now tells the complete story of your analytical decisions. In real research, this is invaluable: when a reviewer asks “did you try X?”, you can look at your commit history and say “yes, here’s what happened when we did X, and here’s why we switched to Y.”"

This assumes a linear relationship and that all other factors are held constant.\n\n\n1.1.2 Question: Which model explains more variance?\nExpected answer: Model 2 (with two predictors) will typically have a higher R-squared than Model 1. However, students should note:\n\nR-squared always increases when you add predictors\nAdjusted R-squared accounts for the number of predictors\nA higher R-squared doesn’t always mean a “better” model\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Question: Interpret the coefficient for rainfall while “controlling for” temperature\nExpected answer: Holding temperature constant, for every 1-unit increase in rainfall, yield changes by [X] units. This is the partial effect of rainfall — the effect of rainfall after accounting for the relationship between temperature and yield.\nDiscussion point: With the provided data, temperature and rainfall are correlated. This can lead to:\n\nCoefficients that differ from simple correlations\nLarger standard errors (multicollinearity)\nDifficulty interpreting “independent” effects"

    "text": "3.3 Station 5: Pollinator Network Complexity — Answer\n\n3.3.1 Why is the Bayesian spatial model overkill?\nThe proposed method (Bayesian multilevel model with spatial Gaussian process) would require: - Spatial coordinates (not provided) - Grouping structure for random effects (not present) - Substantial computation time - Expertise in Bayesian methods - Complex model diagnostics\nFor 25 independent meadows with a simple linear relationship, this is massive overkill.\n\n\n3.3.2 The correct approach: Simple linear regression\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# -------------------------------------------\n# Simulate simple, well-behaved data\n# -------------------------------------------\n\nset.seed(555)\n\nn_meadows &lt;- 25\n\npollinator_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  meadow_id = 1:n_meadows,\n  plant_richness = round(runif(n_meadows, 5, 45))\n) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    # Simple linear relationship with normal errors\n    network_complexity = 1.0 + 0.15 * plant_richness + rnorm(n_meadows, 0, 0.7)\n  )\n\n# Visualize\nggplot(pollinator_data, aes(x = plant_richness, y = network_complexity)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE, color = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Plant Species Richness\", \n       y = \"Network Complexity Score\",\n       title = \"Simple Linear Relationship\")\n\n# -------------------------------------------\n# THE CORRECT APPROACH: Simple lm()\n# -------------------------------------------\n\nsimple_model &lt;- lm(network_complexity ~ plant_richness, data = pollinator_data)\nsummary(simple_model)\n\n# Check assumptions\npar(mfrow = c(2, 2))\nplot(simple_model)\n\n# All assumptions met! We're done.\n\n# -------------------------------------------\n# Discussion: When WOULD complexity be needed?\n# -------------------------------------------\n\n# The complex approach would be appropriate if:\n\n# 1. Meadows were grouped (e.g., multiple meadows per region)\n#    → Need random intercepts for region\n\n# 2. Repeated measures over time\n#    → Need random intercepts for meadow, possibly temporal autocorrelation\n\n# 3. Spatial autocorrelation (nearby meadows more similar)\n#    → Need spatial covariance structure (Gaussian process, CAR, etc.)\n\n# 4. Multiple response variables\n#    → Need multivariate model\n\n# 5. Prior information from previous studies\n#    → Bayesian framework with informative priors\n\n# -------------------------------------------\n# Costs of over-complication\n# -------------------------------------------\n\n# 1. Computation time (hours vs. seconds)\n# 2. More parameters to estimate with limited data (n=25)\n# 3. Harder to interpret and explain\n# 4. More opportunities for errors\n# 5. Reviewers may not understand or trust the analysis\n# 6. May not converge or give unreliable estimates\n# 7. Requires specialized software and expertise\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Key discussion points\nOccam’s Razor in Statistics: Start with the simplest model that addresses your research question. Add complexity only when:\n\nThe simple model clearly fails (poor fit, violated assumptions)\nThe research question requires it (e.g., estimating variance components)\nThe data structure demands it (e.g., hierarchical, spatial, temporal)\n\nRed flags for unnecessary complexity:\n\n“I used a Bayesian spatial model” for simple cross-sectional data\nRandom effects with &lt; 5 groups\nMore parameters than you can reliably estimate\nMethods chosen to seem sophisticated rather than answer the question"

(2021), this is the one you should read.\n\n\n2.1.2 Deliverable:\nYou will give a short lecture ~25 to 30 minutes on the most important aspects of your paper to the other group. YOU ARE THE EXPERTS, so make sure you can answer questions from your “students”. You can use slides, but you don’t have to. You will self-govern your group. Each member can present, just two, or have a single person present.\nYou will have ~10 minutes at the beginning of class to ask questions and make a plan\n\n\n\n2.2 Part 2: Github and R\nMake sure you have downloaded the following:\n\nProgram R\nRStudio\nKnow basics of R and RStudio: https://moctezumaii.github.io/SNR610/installation_instructions.html\nRStudio\nCreate a Github account\nApply for GitHub Education\nJoin the course repository (you will be invited, accept the invite)\nConfirm Codespaces access (we will provide guidance; Codespaces may be enabled by GitHub Education or by the organization)\n\n\n\n2.3 Part 3: Look for papers\nPlease send me any and all papers that you find interesting, would be interested in my taking into account for the course!\nYou should start looking for the paper you want to lead the discussion on!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther tasks to come\n\n\n\nThese are tasks that will come when we start the “collaborative section of the course”\n\nJoin the course repository (you will be invited, accept the invite 😄\nConfirm Codespaces access (I will provide guidance)"
