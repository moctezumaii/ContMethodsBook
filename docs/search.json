Submit: 1 question of something you have a hard time understanding. I will lead the discussion, but be ready to discuss/explain topics. You will then work in groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions To think about while reading\n\n\n\n\nWhen should a fixed effect be treated as random (and vice versa)?\nHow do you diagnose and handle overdispersion and zero-inflation?\nTradeoffs between lme4, glmmTMB, and Bayesian approaches for complex data?\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Part 2: Working in pairs (or trios) (~30 Minutes)\nHalf of you will read chapter 2 of Zuur et al. (2009) (Mixed Effects Models and Extensions in Ecology with R) and the other half chapter 3.\nEach Student gets 8 minutes to give a lecture + 2 minutes for questions.\nFollowing this, students will answer 1) the most important concept, and 2) one question given by me.\nAfter this, they will switch roles.\n\n\n2.1.3 Exit ticket\nWhat was the most challenging thing about today?\n\n\n\n2.2 Session B\nMethods workshop — hands-on coding\n\n2.2.1 Objectives\n\nFit a GLM, GAM, and a GLMM to count and binomial response data.\n\n\n\nInterpret fixed-effect estimates and random-effect variances.\nDiagnose model fit (residuals, overdispersion, zero‑inflation) and fix common problems.\nCompare two model fits and write a concise ecological interpretation.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Preparation:\nInstall the following packages:\n\nlme4\nglmmTMB\nDHARMa\nbroom.mixed\nggplot2\nperformance\n\nClass schedule\n\n5 minutes –&gt; Discussion about overdispersion\n10 minutes –&gt; Demo by me\n30 minutes –&gt; Paired work:\n\nTask A (15 min): Fit Poisson GLM and GLMM on y; extract fixed effect, random variance, compute AIC.\nTask B (15 min): Run DHARMa simulateResiduals on GLMM and inspect plot; note any issue (overdispersion, zero inflation, non-uniform residuals).\nWork in pairs. You can decide how to work\nFigure out issues/problems in the data\n\n10 minutes –&gt; Discussion part 2\nStudents present results –&gt; 5 minutes\nSubmit data"
