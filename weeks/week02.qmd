Week: 2

Topic: Foundational philosophical questions

## Background

Review the following topics if you don't fully understand them:

-   Inference
-   Probability
-   Statistical models
-   Samples and Populations
-   Bias and Variance
-   Frequentist and Bayesian statistics
-   Uncertainty in data analysis


You can use AI or a quick search to help you understand these concepts, but make sure you understand them somewhat

## Learning Objectives

Articulate what statistical models are for and how they function as scientific tools

Explain how uncertainty enters data analysis and how it is handled in different inferential frameworks

Compare frequentist and Bayesian perspectives on statistical inference

Critically evaluate the assumptions underlying quantitative conclusions in published research

## Readings
Everyone Reads both of these papers for a discussion:

@BayesianInferenceEcology
@boxScienceStatistics1976



### Session A:

#### Part 1: Paper discussion (\~40 minutes of the class)

I will open with a short lecture on both papers (15 minutes), then we will have a discussion (25 minutes).

The discussion will be guided by some questions I will write.

## Questions To think about while reading

-   What does it mean for a model to be “useful” rather than “true”?

-   What kinds of uncertainty are explicitly modeled, and which are often ignored?

-   How do Bayesian and frequentist approaches differ in how they treat uncertainty?

-   How do these philosophical perspectives influence how we interpret results in applied research?

#### Part 2: Dataset/coding

We will start coding here. Run a Bayesian example

#### Exit ticket

What was the most challenging thing about today?

### Session B

Methods workshop — hands-on coding
