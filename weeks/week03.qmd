Week: 3

Topic: Statistical Modeling Framework

## Learning Objectives

Connect research questions, data structure and data analysis

## Background

No background this week. After class, review the following topics:

-   Inference
-   Linear Models
-   Distributions
    -   Normal
    -   Binomial
    -   Poisson
    -   Negative Binomial

## Before class
Think about:

-  A dataset you're currently working with (or interested in working with)
-  The main research question you want to answer
-  What is your response variable? What is its distribution? 



### Session A:

#### Part 1: Silent Reflection (10 min)

On the paper I gave you, write the following:

::: {.callout-tip}
## Reflection Prompts
1. **My research question is (one sentence):**

<br>
<br>

2. **My response variable is:** (circle one or write your own)
   - Continuous measurements
   - Counts
   - Binary (yes/no, presence/absence)
   - Proportions
   - Categories
   - Other: ___________

<br>

3. **My data structure includes:** (check all that apply)
   - [ ] Repeated measures on the same units
   - [ ] Multiple sites/plots/locations
   - [ ] Time series
   - [ ] Nested structure (e.g., plants within plots within sites)
   - [ ] Just one observation per unit
   - [ ] Other: ___________

<br>

4. **One worry I have about analyzing my data:**
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

### Part 2: Graffitti discussion (12 minutes)

**Your task:**
- Move freely around the room
- Use markers to write on ANY of the questions (words, phrases, questions, drawings)
- Read what others wrote
- Add +1, arrows, or comments to build on others' ideas
- No names required

::: {.callout-warning}
## The Six Questions

**Wall 1:** "What's the hardest thing about data analysis for you?"

**Wall 2:** "What's the gap between what you learned in stats class and what you actually need/use?"

**Wall 3:** "What do you wish your advisor/committee understood about statistical analysis?"

**Wall 4:** "What statistical concept do you pretend to understand but actually don't?"

**Wall 5:** "What do you want to learn in this class?"

**Wall 6:** "Do you ever feel like you are doing analyses that you do not understand or that might be wrong, but don't know why? If yes, explain"
::: 

#### Post-graffitti (6 min)

Brief discussion of themes and patterns from the walls. This will inform future class topics.


#### Part 3: Main concept --> Lecture

#### The Method-Question-Data Triangle (15 min)
```
     RESEARCH QUESTION
            /\
           /  \
          /    \
         /      \
        /        \
       /          \
DATA TYPE -------- METHOD CHOICE
```

All needed to be aligned. Dr. Molina will give a lecture showing examples of mismatch, good match and overcomplicated model.


#### 🤝 Think-Pair-Share (5 min)

**Activity:**

> Look back at your silent reflection sheet. Based on the three examples:
> 
> - What method might be appropriate for YOUR data?
> - What's one thing about your data structure that makes method choice tricky?

1. **Think** (<1 min) — you already did this... you can use 30 seconds to update your notes
2. **Pair** (3 min) — discuss with a neighbor, help each other troubleshoot
3. **Share** (1 min) — 2–3 volunteers share their pairing's most interesting dilemma

#### Detective Station
### 4. Data Detective: Diagnosis Stations (25 min)

#### Setup

**Six stations** around the room, each with a **scenario card** describing:
- A research question
- A dataset description
- A statistical method that was used (or is being proposed)

**Your job:** Diagnose whether the method fits the question and data.

**Rotation schedule:**
- 4 minutes per station
- Work in pairs or trios
- Record your diagnosis on the station worksheet

#### 🔍 Station 1: Salamander Survival

**Research Question:**  
Does canopy cover affect salamander survival in forest fragments?

**Data:**

- 12 forest fragments
- 20 salamanders marked in each fragment (240 total)
- Survival recorded as binary (alive/dead) after one year
- Canopy cover measured as % for each fragment

**Proposed Method:**  
Logistic regression: `glm(survival ~ canopy_cover, family = binomial)`

**Your Diagnosis:**

- [ ] Good match — use as is
- [ ] Needs modification — what's missing?
- [ ] Wrong method — what would you use instead?

**Why?**

#### 🔍 Station 2: Wheat Yield Trials

**Research Question:**  
Which of 5 wheat varieties produces the highest yield?

**Data:**

- 5 varieties tested in 4 blocks (randomized complete block design)
- One plot per variety per block (20 plots total)
- Yield (kg/ha) recorded once per plot
- Data look approximately normal

**Proposed Method:**  
One-way ANOVA: `aov(yield ~ variety)`

**Your Diagnosis:**

- [ ] Good match — use as is
- [ ] Needs modification — what's missing?
- [ ] Wrong method — what would you use instead?

**Why?**

#### 🔍 Station 3: Bird Abundance Over Time

**Research Question:**  
Is bird abundance declining in urban parks?

**Data:**

- 8 urban parks surveyed
- Each park visited 6 times per year for 5 years (240 total observations)
- Response: count of birds per visit (range: 0–89)
- Year as continuous predictor

**Proposed Method:**  
Linear regression: `lm(bird_count ~ year)`

**Your Diagnosis:**

- [ ] Good match — use as is
- [ ] Needs modification — what's missing?
- [ ] Wrong method — what would you use instead?

**Why?**

#### 🔍 Station 4: Soil Microbial Diversity

**Research Question:**  
Does tillage treatment affect soil microbial diversity?

**Data:**

- 3 treatments: no-till, reduced till, conventional till
- 10 fields per treatment (30 fields total)
- Shannon diversity index calculated for each field (continuous, 0–5)
- Data slightly right-skewed but otherwise well-behaved

**Proposed Method:**  
Kruskal-Wallis test (non-parametric)

**Your Diagnosis:**

- [ ] Good match — use as is
- [ ] Needs modification — what's missing?
- [ ] Wrong method — what would you use instead?

**Why?**

#### 🔍 Station 5: Pollinator Network Complexity

**Research Question:**  
Do pollinator networks become more complex with plant diversity?

**Data:**

- 25 meadows sampled
- Plant diversity (species richness) recorded per meadow
- Network complexity score calculated (continuous, 1.2–8.7)
- Data are normal, linear relationship looks reasonable

**Proposed Method:**  
Bayesian multilevel model with varying intercepts and slopes, spatial Gaussian process

**Your Diagnosis:**

- [ ] Good match — use as is
- [ ] Needs modification — what's missing?
- [ ] Wrong method — what would you use instead?

**Why?**

#### 🔍 Station 6: Seedling Germination Experiment

**Research Question:**  
Does stratification time (0, 30, 60, 90 days) affect germination rate?

**Data:**

- 4 stratification treatments
- 10 petri dishes per treatment (40 dishes)
- 50 seeds per dish
- Response: proportion germinated (0.0–1.0)

**Proposed Method:**  
Linear regression: `lm(proportion ~ stratification_time)`

**Your Diagnosis:**

- [ ] Good match — use as is
- [ ] Needs modification — what's missing?
- [ ] Wrong method — what would you use instead?

**Why?**

#### Exit ticket:
Is thinking about how methods align to your objectives useful? Or would you ratehr start working on code right away?
