## Welcome!

I am very excited to be teaching this class.

-   Today we will be talking about the course.
-    Before this introduction, I talked about the website.
-   We will work together on projects, we will use this to create slideshows

## Things you need for this course

-   Program R

-   RStudio or Positron (new!)

-   Github

-   I recommend you create a Github student account

## Introductions

-   About me:

-   I enjoy numbers, statistics, coding, models and teaching

-   My academic history

## Currently

I mostly teach

Do some research

Serve on committees

Herbert College representative in the Statistics Minor and Masters

## Your turn

1.  Name
2.  Department
3.  Interests both research and something you enjoy to do

## Course overview

PLEASE CHECK THE SYLLABUS ON THE WEBSITE

## Course overview

Learning Outcomes

1.  Critically evaluate quantitative methods in published research across agricultural and natural resource sciences
2.  Implement and adapt these methods using equations, models, and R code
3.  Apply appropriate quantitative approaches to their own research data
4.  Communicate and defend methodological decisions through peer-led discussions and final presentations

## Course lectures

We will use some pretty different teaching and learning strategies. This are being used for three reasons:

1.  There is peer-reviewed evidence that these strategies improve learning outcomes. But I am an empiricist.
2.  You will develop some skills, like oral communication and some teaching abilities, that will be very helpful in your future.
3.  I believe it will make the class engaging.

## This week's assignment
-   Read @tredennick2021 or @zuur2010 depending on your group
-   Give a lecture (~25 minutes) on the paper and lead a short discussion (~5 minutes)
-   Be ready to answer questions from your classmates
-   Use slides or not, your choice
-   You will have 10 minutes at the beginning of next class to prepare with your group
-   You are the experts!

## Zuur et al. 2010
-   A protocol for data exploration to avoid common statistical problems
-   Methods in Ecology and Evolution 1(1):3–14. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2009.00001.x



## Treddennick et al. 2021
-   A practical guide to selecting models for exploration, inference, and prediction in ecology
-   Ecology 102(5):e03375. https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3336
-   Some of you have already read this one!


## Make sure you have everything ready for next classes
-   R and RStudio or Positron installed
-   Positron? What is that?
-   Positron is a new IDE by the makers of RStudio. It is still in beta but looks very promising.

## Next Week

## Notes before the end of the class
-   Office: ANRB 474
-   If you have issues with R or RStudio, please chech the resources section on the website
-   If you are struggling with basic linear models, you can review and work on the materials from SNR 610: https://moctezumaii.github.io/SNR610/ which can be a good resource!
-   This is a collaborative class, we will work together to make it successful for all of us! Feel free to ask anyone for help
-   See you next class!
