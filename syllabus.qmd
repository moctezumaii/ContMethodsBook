Course Description - This graduate-level course explores quantitative methods commonly used in agricultural, food, plant, animal, and natural resource sciences. Students will critically evaluate statistical and modeling techniques in current research, develop the ability to apply quantitative approaches to their own projects, and gain practical experience with equations, algorithms, and R code.

Learning Outcomes

1.  Critically evaluate quantitative methods in published research across agricultural and natural resource sciences.
2.  Implement and adapt these methods using equations, models, and R code.
3.  Apply appropriate quantitative approaches to their own research data.
4.  Communicate and defend methodological decisions through peer-led discussions and final presentations.
