If you are not familiar with Bayesian statistics, focus on the philosophical side of things rather than the technical aspects.\nAnd explore this paper by Thursday: Box (1976) (available at: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2286841?seq=1)\nBox (1976) ‘Science and Statistics’ is VERY dense and had to read, so do not worry about every detail, and you can skim through it. For this class, your goal is to understand three ideas: (1) science as an iteration between theory and data, (2) models as deliberately false but useful, and (3) the need to check and revise models when they clash with data.\n\n3.1 Session A:\n\n3.1.1 Part 1: Lecture by Team B (~ 25 minutes of the class)\nThe team that did not give their lecture today, will be giving a lecture on choosing models.\n\n\n3.1.2 Part 2: Paper discussion (~25 minutes of the class)\nI will open with a short lecture on Ellison (2004) (15 minutes), then we will have a discussion (15 minutes).\nThe discussion will be guided by some questions I will write.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions To think about while reading\n\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean for a model to be “useful” rather than “true”?\nWhat kinds of uncertainty are explicitly modeled, and which are often ignored?\nHow do Bayesian and frequentist approaches differ in how they treat uncertainty?\nHow do these philosophical perspectives influence how we interpret results in applied research?\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Part 2: Dataset/coding\nWe will start coding here. The objective will be to run a Bayesian example on Thursday\n\n\n3.1.4 Exit ticket\nWhat was the most challenging thing about today?\n\n\n\n3.2 Session B\nMethods workshop — hands-on coding Session B has been cancelled"
